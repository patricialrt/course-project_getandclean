##**GETTING AND CLEANING DATA - peer assessment course project** 

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate our ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

### **Description of the task**
You will be required to submit:      
1) a tidy data set,      
2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis (**run_analysis.R**), and      
3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called **CodeBook.md**.  
You should also include a **README.md** (this is the file you are currently reading) in the repo with your scripts. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.
